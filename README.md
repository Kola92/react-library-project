# Requirements

* You are provided with an incomplete <Library /> component.
* You are not allowed to add any additional HTML elements.
* You are not allowed to use refs.

* Once the <Library /> component is mounted, wait 2 seconds and then fetch the book JSON data
  from http://localhost:3000/books.json using `fetch`.
* Once the data is successfully fetched, hide the loading icon.
* Take the "books" array from the fetched data and render each object in it as a <Book/> component.
* Pass in the necessary props to each <Book/> component.
* Typing into the search field should filter books by title and author.
  * That means a book is only shown if either its "title" and/or "author" field contains the search query.
  * The search should be case insensitive.
    For example, "Da Vinci Code" is shown if you search for "da vinci", "Da Vinci" or "DA VincI", etc.
  * If the search field is empty, show all books.
* Clicking the up arrow should change the book order to show the oldest books first.
* Clicking the down arrow should change the book order to show the newest books first.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
